__This article is a translation from the original one in Spanish, [Vim como
editor de codigo Python][orig], published in April 2013.__

This is an article that I've always wanted to write: "Vim as Python IDE". Two
years ago I had a Vim configuration that I thought that was just right for this,
even a half-written article. But while I was polishing the config and finishing
the article, a bunch of similar articles appeared in the internet and after
reading them I realized something: many of them were already obsolete at the
time they were published. And I say this because many of them employed plugins
that were outdated by the emerge of other fresh and more powerful. In fact in
the last two years, the Vim environment has evolved too much that from all the
plugins that I used in those days (and the ones pending to test), currently I'm
using only 10% of them, the rest are new ones. And this "race" to provide new
and more powerful features for Vim continues nowadays, with some great tools.

On the other hand, as one is adding plugins and "tuning" his config, there comes
a time when you don't know where and what is already mapped, even no
remember at all the plugins at features available for you, and which you
implemented with so much effort and time.


## My configuration

Given these two premises I had the idea of kill two birds with one stone:
__Document my Vim setup__. What I'm trying with this is that should work for me
as sort of cheat-sheet to remember all that I had available in my config, and at
the same time to have a coherent mapping and avoid duplicates (at least is the
idea). By the other hand, it works also to demonstrate all the Vim's potential
to edit Python code and compete with almost any IDE, but with all the advantages
of the unique Vim's way.

The idea is to have a continuously updated document with respect to my current
setup, What better article than this, an always updated one?

This is the link to this doc, `README.md`, included in my dotfiles
repository:

*English is not my mother tongue, so maybe the article (and the doc) can be full
of grammatical mistakes due to my poor English. Sorry for that, I did my best.*
